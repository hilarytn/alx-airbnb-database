# Advanced SQL Join Queries

This directory contains SQL scripts that demonstrate the use of different types of SQL joins on an Airbnb-like database system. These queries are written to deepen understanding of how to retrieve related data across multiple tables using `INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`, and `FULL OUTER JOIN`.

## Files

- `joins_queries.sql`: Contains three SQL queries showcasing the following joins:
  - **INNER JOIN**: Retrieves all bookings with their associated users.
  - **LEFT JOIN**: Retrieves all properties with their reviews, including those without reviews.
  - **FULL OUTER JOIN**: Retrieves all users and all bookings, regardless of whether a booking is linked to a user.
